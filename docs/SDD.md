1. Introduction
 
1.1 Purpose
This Software Design Description (SDD) document provides a detailed overview of the Equipment Checkout System (ECS) design. It contains information necessary for software developers to implement the system.
 
1.2 Scope
The ECS will manage the checkout process of equipment and tools for GB Manufacturing's maintenance department, tracking approximately 10,000 employees across multiple plants in the New York City area.

2. System Overview
 
The Equipment Checkout System (ECS) is designed to automate and control the equipment checkout process for GB Manufacturing's maintenance department. The system will:
- Track equipment checkout/return processes
- Verify employee skills and authorizations
- Monitor equipment status and location
- Generate alerts for overdue or missing equipment
- Manage inventory across multiple warehouse locations
- Provide reporting capabilities for management
 
3. System Architecture
 
The system uses a three-tier architecture:
 
3.1 Presentation Layer
- Web-based user interface
- Mobile-responsive design
- Role-based access control
 
3.2 Business Logic Layer
- Equipment management services
- Employee authentication and authorization
- Transaction processing
- Notification system
- Reporting engine
 
3.3 Data Layer
- Relational database
- Data access layer
- Audit logging
- Backup and recovery systems
 
 
4. Data Dictionary
 
Entities
1. Employee
   - employeeId (int): Unique identifier
   - name (String): Employee's full name
   - skills (List<Skill>): Employee's certified skills
   - location (String): Assigned work location
 
2. Equipment
   - equipmentId (int): Unique identifier
   - name (String): Equipment name
   - status (Status): Current state
   - value (double): Monetary value
   - requiredSkill (Skill): Required skill level
 
3. Transaction
   - transactionId (int): Unique identifier
   - checkoutDate (DateTime): When equipment was checked out
   - returnDate (DateTime): When equipment was returned
   - status (TransactionStatus): Current state
 
 
5. Component Design
  
5.1 Object-Oriented Analysis Overview
 
5.1.1 Key Domain Objects:
- Maintenance Employee (with specialized skills)
- Equipment/Tools
- Warehouses (Main and Satellite)
- Inventory Items
- Work Orders
- Equipment Transactions
 
5.1.2 Primary Objects and Responsibilities:
- Employee: Maintenance staff who check out equipment
- Equipment:  Tools and machinery tracked by the system
- Transaction:  Records of checkouts and returns
- Warehouse:  Locations storing equipment and materials
- Skill Classification: Employee qualifications for equipment use
 
5.1.3 Key Behaviors:
- Equipment checkout/return process
- Status tracking and updates
- Inventory management
- Skills verification
- Transaction recording
 
5.2 Static Design (Class Diagram)


 
The class diagram shows the relationships between:
- Employee and Equipment (through Transaction)
- Employee and Skill Classification
- Equipment and Warehouse
- Transaction linking Employee and Equipment
 
5.3 Dynamic Design (Sequence Diagram)


 
The sequence diagram illustrates the equipment checkout process:
- Employee initiates equipment request
- System verifies employee skills and equipment availability
- System creates transaction record
- System confirms checkout to employee
 
5.4 Design Patterns
 
5.4.1 Observer Pattern
Selected to handle equipment status monitoring and notifications. This pattern will:
- Enable automatic notification of managers for overdue equipment
- Allow real-time inventory updates
- Facilitate tracking of equipment status changes
- Provide loose coupling between equipment status and notification system
 
5.4.2 Singleton Pattern
Will be implemented for the main checkout system to ensure a single point of control for all transactions:
- Maintain consistent system state
- Centralize transaction processing
- Prevent multiple instances of critical system components
- Ensure data consistency across all operations
 
5.5 Design Quality Review
 
5.5.1 Design Principles Implementation
Single Responsibility Principle: 
- Employee class manages only employee-related data and operations
- Equipment class handles only equipment state and attributes
- Transaction class focuses solely on checkout records
- Each class has a clear, single purpose
 
Open/Closed Principle: 
- New equipment types can be added without modifying existing code
- Additional transaction types can be implemented through inheritance
- System can be extended to handle new requirements without core changes
 
5.5.2 Key Design Decisions:
- Separated employee and equipment management
- Centralized transaction processing
- Integrated skill verification
- Comprehensive status tracking
 
5.5.3 Problem Resolution:
The design addresses the main problems through:
- Equipment loss tracking through transaction records
- Skills verification before equipment checkout
- Real-time status monitoring
- Centralized control of checkout operations
 
6. Human Interface Design
 
6.1 Main Dashboard
- Equipment availability status
- Recent transactions
- Alerts and notifications
- Quick checkout functionality
 
6.2 Equipment Checkout Screen
- Equipment search and filters
- Skill requirement verification
- Checkout confirmation process
- Due date assignment
 
6.3 Return Processing Screen
- Equipment condition assessment
- Return confirmation
- Damage reporting capability
